Game Off 2024 
Theme: SECRETS

Optional challenges:
Small Pallete (4 or less colors)
Cheat mode (cheat codes)
Speedrun (focus on speed and shortcuts)

---------------------------------------------

a 2d metroidvania where most abilites are hidden 
(aka rooms that are revealed when walked into)

some central mechanic to help you locate rooms
theres a cooldown to use it tho (cheat code to refresh it?)
- echolocation (!): send out a wave and it bounces off secrets

main character is bat then? 
or maybe a beluga (and make the whole game underwater?)
both cases may indicate free roam flight, hm

visual style?
- we can go pixel art, same as last game
- try something new? (maybe not with this already huge scope)

so. detective bat metroidvania

OH we can do a pacifist style game, no combat!

abilities:
- shriek: stuns enemies momentarily
- dash: swoop quickly to not take damage from enemies
- maybe you dont start out being able to fly?
- pickups for health and 'mana' 100%

flying consumes the same mana as echolocate

mana system can be similar to 'a short hike'/'refreshed', 
with defined usable 'double' jumps


---------------------------------------------

Post Jam Note:
There are no enemies in the game, i thought it would complicate a bit too much and wouldnt fit
